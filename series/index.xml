This involves breaking down an audio signal into its components, such as volume, frequency, and beats. These components are then mapped to visual parameters like position, color, size, or shape of the animation elements. For instance, a bass drum beat might make a shape pulse or change color, while a high-pitched note could make lines oscillate or rotate.
